## Summary
The HyperBolts compiler is an opinionated JavaScript bundler, asset compiler and watcher with built-in support for React hot loading. It provides a robust development environment for React projects, with out of the box support including:

- JavaScript bundling (using Webpack)
- React hot loading
- Local webserver
- Synchronised browser testing (BrowserSync)
- ES6 to ES5 transpiling (Babel)
- SASS compiling
- Image minification
- Watch code for changes

## Installation
To install the latest stable version, run the following commands at the root of your project:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install --save gulp hyperbolts-compiler
```

Then create a file named `gulpfile.js`, contaning:

```
require('hyperbolts-compiler').run();
```

## Usage
```
gulp --watch
```

Remove the `--watch` flag to output built code only.

## Configuration
The following code sources/destinations are configured by default:

| Type        | Source                             | Destination
|:----        |:------                             |:-----------
| **Base**    |                                    | dist
| **Bundles** | src/index.jsx                      | bundle.js
| **Images**  | assets/images/**                   | assets/images
| **Static**  | assets/fonts/**                    | assets/fonts
|             | assets/public/**                   | /
| **Styles**  | assets/styles/**/[^_]*.{sass,scss} | assets/styles

Configuration can be overridden by passing a config object when calling `.run()`. For example:

```
require('hyperbolts-compiler').run({
    bundle: {
        src:  'src/index.jsx',
        dest: 'dist/bundle.js'
    }
});
```

Multiple sources are also supported with the following syntax:

```
require('hyperbolts-compiler').run({
    bundle: [
        {
            src:  'src/frontend/index.jsx',
            dest: 'dist/frontend.js'
        },
        {
            src:  'src/backend/index.jsx',
            dest: 'dist/backend.js'
        }
    ]
});
```

You can also pass a watch key to monitor something other than the source. See the [default config](https://github.com/hyperbolts/compiler/blob/master/src/config.js) file for more information.

## Quickstart
Let's build a "hello world" example from scratch to show how easy it is to develop with this compiler! Complete the installation steps above, then install React:

```
npm install --save react react-dom
```

Now create the application entry point at `src/index.jsx`, containing:

```
import React    from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
    document.getElementById('__react_mount')
);
```

Finally, create an index file at `assets/public/index.html` to the generated bundle:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <div id="__react_mount" />
        <script src="bundle.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now run the compiler with `--watch`:

```
gulp --watch
```

Try changing the hello world message, your changes will be injected in real time. Magic!

## Troubleshooting
- **I'm getting errors about babel-loader when using npm2. What have I done wrong?**  
npm2 resolves dependencies differently to npm3. To fix, run the following command:

  ```
  npm install --save babel-loader babel-preset-latest babel-preset-react react-hot-loader webpack-dev-middleware webpack-hot-middleware webpack-module-hot-accept
  ```

- **My file changes are not being picked up?**  
See [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html#watching) for possible issues.
